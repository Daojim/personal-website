# Hello World: I'm Jimmy!

I wanted to go further into detail on what this personal website is for. It's a place where I can share my thoughts to whoever will read this,
where I document my journey on learning technologies, my interests, and a portfolio to showcase my projects.

## Building this website

So far, I've used React + Vite + TypeScript for the frontend of this website. I want to incorporate a backend to make it a full-stack, but I haven't exactly thought about how to implement it yet.
I've made a few projects using React using YouTube tutorials, but I wanted to make a project from scratch with minimal help. In school, I was taught on how to use Angular, which definitely helped with learning TypeScript.
I started using Obsidian to take notes and that's where I learned how useful markdown is for formatting. I wanted to make this website incorporate markdown for writing blog posts, so I'm trying out MDX.

I will slowly work on this website, as this is a project I want to take my time on instead of rushing it. Part of the reason I'm trying to do a full-stack is to learn more about backend development, as I have little experience with it. However, I can't stand it when a project I create doesn't look nice, so I'm putting some time to make the frontend look good first.

## My interests

Gaming will always be my first and foremost interest. I've been playing video games since I was a child, starting with Kirby's Adventure on the NES. I will write a detailed blog post about this since I have a lot to say about it. I'll write about how I started playing games, the different genres I've played, and the impact they've had on my life.

The next interest I have is weightlifting. I don't know if I'll document that because admittedly, I'm not consistent in it since I tend to get some sort of sickness after a few months. I believe I don't recover fast enough with how much physical stress I put on my body as well as the mental stress from life/school. I always try to push myself and train like I did when I was younger, but I don't get enough sleep like I did back then. Whenever I don't get enough sleep, I usually end up with a cold or sickness that sets me back once again. I really need to be satisfied with going to the gym less than 4 times a week, or give myself more time to recover.

## Future blog posts

I have a few ideas for future blog posts, so I'll jot them down here to remind myself on what to write in no particular order:

- My history with gaming
- Why I went back to college, again
- My top 9 games of all time
- My journey with weightlifting
- Maybe a post deeper into personal thoughts
- FFXIV raiding and what it taught me about teamwork
